We had initially gathered our crude ideas on how the C Project would look like. Starting with the RGB color scheme and how to convert the individual pixels to their respective grayscale values. We learnt that a byte is needed to store color values and 3 bytes used together yields a colored pixel. Next we learnt about the bmp file format. It consisted of headers which held relevant data and also learnt how to read and write the data to buffers.

We had divided our work as follows-

1. **_Shubhanshu_** has helped our team with the reading part of our code. Essentially the read part simply copies our bmp data onto a buffer which we have defined based on the file format.

2. **_Chinthan_** has helped us with the main.c file and the relevant struct declarations.

3. **_Gousepeer_** helped us with make file

4. **_Rudransh_** has helped us with the writing part which essentially writes our modified 8bit bmp file onto a new user defined buffer.

5. **_Tarun_** and **_Anmol_** have done the conversion part wherein the individual pixel data is modified as per the requirements.
